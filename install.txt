PART 1

1. Clone the repository locally:  https://github.com/prizmaweb/llm_course/

2. Run python --version to find out which python you're on.
Ideally you'd be using a version of Python 3.11, so we're completely in sync.
Do not install later versions.  But Python 3.12 may work  too. 

If you need to install Python or install another version, you can download it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. Navigate to the "project root directory" using cd ~/Documents/Projects/llm_course (replace this path with the actual path to the llm_course directory, your locally cloned version of the repo). Do ls and check you can see subdirectories for each week of the course.
Then, create a new virtual environment with this command:
python -m venv llms

4. Activate the virtual environment with
source llms/bin/activate You should see (llms) in your command prompt, which is your sign that things are going well.

5. Run python -m pip install --upgrade pip followed by pip install -r requirements.txt
This may take a few minutes to install. In the very unlikely event that this doesn't go well, you should try the bullet-proof (but slower) version:
pip install --retries 5 --timeout 15 --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt

6. Start Jupyter Lab:
From within the llm_course folder, type: jupyter lab

...and Jupyter Lab should open up, ready for you to get started. Success! Now close down jupyter lab and move on to Part 2
If it does not, please install:
 pip install jupyterlab

PART 2 - OpenAI key (OPTIONAL)
   1. Create your API key
The webpage where you set up your OpenAI key is at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys - press the green 'Create new secret key' button and press 'Create secret key'. Keep a record of the API key somewhere private; you won't be able to retrieve it from the OpenAI screens in the future. It should start sk-proj
   2. Create an OpenAI account if you don't have one by visiting: https://platform.openai.com/
   3. OpenAI asks for a minimum credit to use the API. For  the US, it's $5. The API calls will spend against this $5. But if you'd prefer not to pay for the API, do  the course using Ollama.
You can add your credit balance to OpenAI at Settings > Billing:
https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview

Disable the automatic recharge!

4.create a .env file in the llm_course folder and paste the open ai api key inside like this : 
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
Save the .env file
